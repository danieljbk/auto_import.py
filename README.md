# auto_import.py
This script checks if modules can be imported on another python file and automatically installs modules that have not been installed.


# Instructions:
1. `from auto_import import auto_import`
2. `exec(auto_import("module name"))`


When the user runs the program, all necessary modules will be installed on their own.


###### As of now, auto_import.py has not been set up to handle 'from * import *' commands.
